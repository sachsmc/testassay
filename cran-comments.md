This is a resubmission to CRAN to address warnings reported on the CRAN checks. I fixed the warning caused by an old version of dplyr (and removed it from Suggests). I also added a reference and citation. Checked on the following platforms and versions: 

- Windows, R release and devel
- Ubuntu 12.40, R release 
- Fedora Linux, R devel
